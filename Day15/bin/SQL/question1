 Q1/- What is JDBC, Write a note on JDBC driver software.
 
 A)JDBC:
   ====
 
         1) Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, which defines how a client
           
            may access any kind of tabular data, especially relational database. It is part of Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation
          
         2) The JDBC classes are contained in the Java Package java.sql and javax.sql. JDBC helps you to write Java applications that manage these three 
            programming activities:

				1) Connect to a data source, like a database.
				2) Send queries and update statements to the database
				3) Retrieve and process the results received from the database in answer to your query
 
 B)JDBC driver :
   =============

			--it is a translation software written in Java according to the JDBC specification (it comes in the form of Jar file.)
			
		1) Responsibility of JDBC driver s/w :
		   =================================
			
			1. establishing the Connection.
			
			2. receiving the JDBC method calls (java method call ) and translate them into DBMS understandable format.(SQL) and forward them to the DB s/w.
			
			3.Translating the DB s/w given result into the Java format (Java objects) and returns that object to the JDBC client.
			
			
		2) Step of connect our java application with the DB server (mysql):
		   ===============================================================
			
			1. download/get the jdbc driver related jar file (mysql-connector.jar) and set that jar file inside the classpath of our application.
			
			2.Load the Driver related main class into the memory.
			
			3. prepare the Connection string.
			
			4. establish the connection.
			
			5.after performing the CRUD operation close the connection.
			
		3)  Setting the jar file in the classpath of our application:
			=======================================================
			
			rightclick on the project----> build path ----> configure build path---->libraries---->Classpath---->Add External jars--->
			select the downloaded jar file ----> apply and close.
