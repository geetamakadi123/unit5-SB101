Q2/ Write an application to establish the connection between the Java application and Mysql database Server.


ANS===>

     1) To connect Java application with the MySQL database, we need to follow 5 following steps.

     2) In this example we are using MySql as the database. So we need to know following informations for the mysql database:

	       a) Driver class: The driver class for the mysql database is com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.
	       
	       b) Connection URL: The connection URL for the mysql database is "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/namu"
	                     where, jdbc is the API, 
	                            mysql is the database, 
	                            localhost is the server name on which mysql is running, 
	                            we may also use IP address, 
	                            3306 is the port number and 
	                            sonoo is the  database name. We may use any database, in such case, we need to replace the sonoo with our database name.
	                            
	       c) Username: The default username for the mysql database is root.
	       
	       d) Password: It is the password given by the user at the time of installing the mysql database. In this example, we are going to use root as the 
	                    password. Let's first create a table in the mysql database, but before creating table, we need to create database first.

    3)  for Explaining concept I create Demo class. For clarification run the File we get the successfull running message as==> "Connected...." i.e. we 
        can retrieve the data from the SQL s/w successfully.
