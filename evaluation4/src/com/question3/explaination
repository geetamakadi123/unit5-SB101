Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention  how to
establish these relationships among tables with examples.


ans:
There are three types of relationships in Database:
One to One
One to Many
Many to Many
In a relational database,each table is connected to another table using the Primary Foreign key constraints.

One to one Relation:
In one to one relation, one record of the first table will be linked to one of another table.
Example: each employee in the employee table will row in employee detalis table stored the detail for that particular employe. so each employee have one record in the employee details table.
this the one to one relation.

One to many Relation:
one to many relation is used mostly in relationship tables. A single record from one table can be linked to more rows in another tables.
Example:we may have one to many relationship between a person and 
bank account where one person can have many 
bank accounts but a bank account can only have one specific owner.

Many to many:
One record in the first table relates to many records in the second table and vice versa.
Example:student and course where one student can take many 
courses and each course can be taken by many students.
