Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().
Ans:
PriorityQueue() can be found inside Queue() where LinkedList() can  be found in both
Queue() as well as List().
both of these are from java.util package

As we are comparing PriorityQueue() with linkedlist() we will compare according to LinkedList() preset in Queue().

In case of PriorityQueue() its main objective is to print its element in sorted order
where LinkedList() in queque() is not perticularly used for sorting ,it gives n number of extra methods which helps in LIKE:
Accesing/deleting first element .
Accesing/deleting Last element.

It gives a method called remove() which can directly remove that perticularly on element from list;

we can use above method by using Iterator().
